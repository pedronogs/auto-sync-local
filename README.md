# Automatic backup between local and network shared folder (or local too) (auto-sync-local)

> IN DEVELOPMENT

This is a fork from [auto-sync-drive](https://github.com/pedronogs/auto-sync-drive) to work with local folders (and shared network folders). If you want to use this, just check the steps in the other repository as it is pretty much the same thing. This was a request received from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsWjsRw0oW4&ab_channel=PedroNogs).
